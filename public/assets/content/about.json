            "text": "Just the Ducks is a group of 6 coders by day and NASA enthusiasts by night. Our group was formed while seeking unique coding experiences outside of our normal work environment. We spend our days building and supporting information systems for a mild mannered insurance company in Flint, Michigan. By night we challenge ourselves with coding and camaraderie. We joined the 2022 NASA Space Apps challenge with the goal of expanding our skills and experiencing NASA to the fullest.",
